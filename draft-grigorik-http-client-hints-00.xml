      <t>An increasing diversity of connected device form factors and software capabilities has created a need to deliver varying, or optimized content for each device.</t>
      <t>The ‘Client-Hints’ header field for HTTP requests allows the client to describe its preferences and capabilities to an origin server to enable cache-friendly, server-side content adaptation, without imposing additional latency and deferred evaluation on the client.</t>
      <t>Client-Hints also has the advantage of being able to transmit dynamic client preferences, such as available bandwidth, or current viewport size, which cannot be inferred through static client signature databases.</t>

    <section anchor="introduction" title="Introduction">
      <t>There are thousands of different devices accessing the web, each with different device capabilities and preference information. These device capabilities include hardware and software characteristics, as well as information about the state of the network to which the device is connected to.</t>
      <t>One way to infer some of these capabilities is through User-Agent (UA) detection against an established database of client signatures. However, this technique requires acquiring such a database, keeping it up to date, and in many cases is simply not sufficient to do the device identification due to lack of enough unique information within the UA header.</t>
      <t>
        <list style="symbols">
          <t>UA detection is not reliable</t>
          <t>UA detection is not cache friendly</t>
          <t>UA detection depends on acquiring and maintenance of external databases</t>
          <t>UA detection is unable to infer dynamic client preferences, such as current network conditions, or user-specified preferences (ex, decisions made while roaming)</t>
        </list>
      </t>
      <t>This document defines a new request header field, “Client-Hints”, that allows the client to make available hints, both static and dynamic, for servers about its preference and capabilities. “Client-Hints” allows server-side content adaption without imposing additional latency on the client, or requiring the use of additional device databases.</t>

    <section anchor="the-client-hints-request-header-field" title="The “Client-Hints” Request Header Field">
      <t>The “Client-Hints” request header field describes the current client preferences that the server can use to adapt and optimize the resource to satisfy a given request.</t>
      <t>The Client-Hints field-value is a comma-delimited list of header fields. The  field-name values are case insensitive.</t>
      <section anchor="client-hints-header-fields" title="Client-Hints Header Fields">
        <t>The client controls which header fields are communicated within the Client-Hints header, based on its default settings, or based on user configuration and preferences. The user may be given the choice to enable, disable, or override specific hints. For example, to allow the request for low-resolution images or other content type’s while roaming on a foreign network, even while on a high-bandwidth link.</t>
        <t>The client and server, or an intermediate proxy, may use an additional mechanism to negotiate which fields should be reported to allow for efficient content adaption.</t>

        <t>Browser Hints specifies a mechanism whereby origin servers can make available hints for browsers (clients) about their preferences and capabilities, without imposing overhead on their interactions or requiring support for them.</t>
        <t>Through the use of Browser Hints, the server can advertise the support for specific Client Hint variables or capabilities, allowing the client to avoid sending variables which will have no effect on the server.</t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="interaction-with-http-proxies" title="Interaction with HTTP proxies">
        <t>Client Hints are designed to optimize interaction with existing cache and proxy servers.</t>
        <t>When a resource is optimized based on the specified client hint information, a Vary response header can be specified for upstream cache and proxy servers. For fine-grained control, the Key response header could be used to define a custom cache key based on an individual or a combination of client hint values.</t>
        <t>An optimizing proxy may also use an additional mechanism, such as Browser Hints, to negotiate which client hints can be communicated to enable better content adaptation.</t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="interaction-with-user-agent" title="Interaction with User Agent">
        <t>Client Hints does not supersede or replace User-Agent. Existing device detection mechanisms can continue to use both mechanisms if necessary.</t>
        <t>By advertising its capabilities within a request header, Client Hints allows for cache friendly, and explicit content adaptation.</t>

   In many standards track documents several words are used to signify
   the requirements in the specification.  These words are often
   capitalized.  This document defines these words as they should be
   interpreted in IETF documents.  Authors who follow these guidelines
   should incorporate this phrase near the beginning of their document:

<list><t>
      The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
      NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and
      "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
      RFC 2119.
</t></list></t>
            <t>
   Note that the force of these words is modified by the requirement
   level of the document in which they are used.

          <abstract>
            <t>Internet technical specifications often need to define a formal syntax.  Over the years, a modified version of Backus-Naur Form (BNF), called Augmented BNF (ABNF), has been popular among many Internet specifications.  The current specification documents ABNF.  It balances compactness and simplicity with reasonable representational power.  The differences between standard BNF and ABNF involve naming rules, repetition, alternatives, order-independence, and value ranges.  This specification also supplies additional rule definitions and encoding for a core lexical analyzer of the type common to several Internet specifications. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</t>

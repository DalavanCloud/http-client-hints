      <t>An increasing diversity of connected device form factors and software capabilities has created a need to deliver varying, or optimized content for each device.</t>
      <t>The ‘Client-Hints’ header field for HTTP requests allows the client to describe its preferences and capabilities to an origin server to enable cache-friendly, server-side content adaptation, without imposing additional latency and deferred evaluation on the client.</t>
      <t>Client-Hints also has the advantage of being able to transmit dynamic client preferences, such as available bandwidth, or current viewport size, which cannot be inferred through static client signature databases.</t>

      <t>There are thousands of different devices accessing the web, each with different device capabilities and preference information. These device capabilities include hardware and software characteristics, as well as information about the state of the network to which the device is connected to.</t>
      <t>One way to infer some of these capabilities is through User-Agent detection against an established database of client signatures. However, this technique requires acquiring such a database, keeping it up to date, and in many cases is simply not sufficient to distinguish the various devices with the same  fingerprint. User-Agent detection is:</t>
      <t>
        <list style="symbols">
          <t>Offers unreliable device detection</t>
          <t>Depends on acquiruing and maitenance of external databases</t>
          <t>Not cache friendly, as it is not practical to Vary on User-Agent, and provides no fine-grained control to Vary content based on device capabilities or prefernces</t>
          <t>Unable to infer dynamic client preferences, such as current network conditions, or user-specified preferences (ex, decisions made while roaming)</t>
        </list>
      </t>
      <t>This document defines a new request header field, “Client-Hints”, that allows the client to make available hints for servers about its preference or capabilities, to allow server-side content adaption without impossing additional latency on the client, or requiring the use of additional device databases.</t>

      <t>The “Client-Hints” request header field describes the current client preferences that the server can use to adapt and optimize the resource to satisfy a given request.</t>
      <t>The Client-Hints field-value is a comma-delimited list of well-defined header fields, delimited by semicolons. Both the field-name and modifier names themselves are case insensitive.</t>

          </t>
          <t>The dc value is the integer value of the bitfield, with the following indexes:</t>

              <t>CSS Level 2.1 with 75%+ on ACID2 test     (good CSS support)</t>
              <t>CSS Level 3 with 75%+ on ACID3 test       (excellent CSS support)</t>

          </t>
          <t>… (TBD: more?)</t>
          <t>Each bit should be marked as 1 if the client meets the criteria. For example, for a device which supports all of the above criteria, the bitmap is “11111111”, which is equivalent to dc=255. For a device, which supports JavaScript and has good CSS support, but does not support XMLHttpRequest, touch, or WebP the bitmap is “00010111”, which is equivalen tto dc=23.</t>
          <t>// (Ilya) the downside to this approach is that we’re hardcoding these values into the spec, and they <spanx style="emph">will</spanx> get out of sync. It would better if we could define a layer of indirection here, which would allow us to be more feature proof. For example: simply define class A,B,C,D,E (5 out to be enough ;-)), and pull out the definition of each into a separate (external) mechanism, such that as devices evolve, we can reclaim or upgrade what each class defines.</t>

        <t>Client Hints are designed to optimize interaction with existing cache and proxy servers.</t>
        <t>When a resource is optimized based on the specified Client Hint information, a Vary response header can be specified for upstream cache and proxy servers. For fine-grained control, the Key response header could be used to define a custom cache key based on an individual or a combination of client hint values.</t>
        <t>Unlike the User-Agent string, which is a sinle opaque string, Client Hints provides a stable, customizable, cache friendly mechanism for content adaptation.</t>

        <t>Browser Hints specifies a mechanism whereby origin servers can make available hints for browsers (clients) about their preferences and capabilities, without imposing overhead on their interactions or requiring support for them.</t>
        <t>Through the use of Browser Hints, the server can advertise the support for specific Client Hint variables or capabilities, allowing the client to avoid sending variables which will have no effect on the server.</t>

   In many standards track documents several words are used to signify
   the requirements in the specification.  These words are often
   capitalized.  This document defines these words as they should be
   interpreted in IETF documents.  Authors who follow these guidelines
   should incorporate this phrase near the beginning of their document:

<list><t>
      The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
      NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and
      "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
      RFC 2119.
</t></list></t>
            <t>
   Note that the force of these words is modified by the requirement
   level of the document in which they are used.

            <t>Internet technical specifications often need to define a formal syntax.  Over the years, a modified version of Backus-Naur Form (BNF), called Augmented BNF (ABNF), has been popular among many Internet specifications.  The current specification documents ABNF.  It balances compactness and simplicity with reasonable representational power.  The differences between standard BNF and ABNF involve naming rules, repetition, alternatives, order-independence, and value ranges.  This specification also supplies additional rule definitions and encoding for a core lexical analyzer of the type common to several Internet specifications. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</t>

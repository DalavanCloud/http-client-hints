                  draft-grigorik-http-client-hints-00

Abstract

   An increasing diversity of connected device form factors and software
   capabilities has created a need to deliver varying, or optimized
   content for each device.

   The 'Client-Hints' header field for HTTP requests allows the client
   to describe its preferences and capabilities to an origin server to
   enable cache-friendly, server-side content adaptation, without
   imposing additional latency and deferred evaluation on the client.

   Client-Hints also has the advantage of being able to transmit dynamic
   client preferences, such as available bandwidth, or current viewport
   size, which cannot be inferred through static client signature
   databases.

Internet-Draft              HTTP Client Hints              December 2012


1.  Introduction

   There are thousands of different devices accessing the web, each with
   different device capabilities and preference information.  These
   device capabilities include hardware and software characteristics, as
   well as information about the state of the network to which the
   device is connected to.

   One way to infer some of these capabilities is through User-Agent
   (UA) detection against an established database of client signatures.
   However, this technique requires acquiring such a database, keeping
   it up to date, and in many cases is simply not sufficient to do the
   device identification due to lack of enough unique information within
   the UA header.

   o  UA detection is not reliable
   o  UA detection is not cache friendly
   o  UA detection depends on acquiring and maintenance of external
      databases
   o  UA detection is unable to infer dynamic client preferences, such
      as current network conditions, or user-specified preferences (ex,
      decisions made while roaming)

   This document defines a new request header field, "Client-Hints",
   that allows the client to make available hints, both static and
   dynamic, for servers about its preference and capabilities.  "Client-
   Hints" allows server-side content adaption without imposing
   additional latency on the client, or requiring the use of additional
   device databases.

1.1.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   This document uses the Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF) notation of
   [RFC5234] with the list rule extension defined in
   [I-D.ietf-httpbis-p1-messaging], Appendix B.  It includes by
   reference the OWS, field-name and quoted-string rules from that
   document, and the parameter rule from
   [I-D.ietf-httpbis-p2-semantics].


2.  The "Client-Hints" Request Header Field

   The "Client-Hints" request header field describes the current client
   preferences that the server can use to adapt and optimize the

   resource to satisfy a given request.

   The Client-Hints field-value is a comma-delimited list of header
   fields.  The field-name values are case insensitive.

2.1.  Client-Hints Header Fields

   The client controls which header fields are communicated within the
   Client-Hints header, based on its default settings, or based on user
   configuration and preferences.  The user may be given the choice to
   enable, disable, or override specific hints.  For example, to allow
   the request for low-resolution images or other content type's while
   roaming on a foreign network, even while on a high-bandwidth link.

   The client and server, or an intermediate proxy, may use an
   additional mechanism to negotiate which fields should be reported to
   allow for efficient content adaption.

   This document defines the following well-known hint names:

2.1.1.  bw

   o  Description: Bandwidth (bw) of the current client connection, in
      kbps.
   o  Value Type: number

2.1.2.  vv

   o  Description: Visual Viewport (vv) size of the client, in CSS
      pixels (ex, 720x1024).
   o  Value Type: string

2.1.3.  dpr

   o  Description: Device Pixel Ratio (dpr), is the ratio between
      physical pixels and device-independent pixels on the device.
   o  Value Type: number

2.2.  Interaction with Browser Hints

   Browser Hints specifies a mechanism whereby origin servers can make
   available hints for browsers (clients) about their preferences and
   capabilities, without imposing overhead on their interactions or
   requiring support for them.

   Through the use of Browser Hints, the server can advertise the
   support for specific Client Hint variables or capabilities, allowing
   the client to avoid sending variables which will have no effect on

   the server.

2.3.  Interaction with HTTP proxies

   Client Hints are designed to optimize interaction with existing cache
   and proxy servers.

   When a resource is optimized based on the specified client hint
   information, a Vary response header can be specified for upstream
   cache and proxy servers.  For fine-grained control, the Key response
   header could be used to define a custom cache key based on an
   individual or a combination of client hint values.

   An optimizing proxy may also use an additional mechanism, such as
   Browser Hints, to negotiate which client hints can be communicated to
   enable better content adaptation.

2.4.  Interaction with User Agent

   Client Hints does not supersede or replace User-Agent.  Existing
   device detection mechanisms can continue to use both mechanisms if
   necessary.

   By advertising its capabilities within a request header, Client Hints
   allows for cache friendly, and explicit content adaptation.


3.  IANA Considerations

   TBD


4.  Security Considerations

   The client controls which header fields are communicated and when.
   In cases such as incognito or anonymous profile browsing, the header
   can be omitted entirely if necessary.
